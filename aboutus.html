			<h1>About Us</h1>
			<p>Seabubbles Hawaii is a premier scuba diving center located in the heart of Waikiki, just 10 minutes away from all hotels. We offer scuba diving trips off our boat to both certified and non-certified divers. Our experienced and certified PADI Master Instructor leads dives with a maximum ratio of 4:1, ensuring a safe and personalized experience for each diver.</p>

			<p>We provide all equipment necessary for the dive, or you may bring your own. Our boats and captain are regularly checked and licensed by the Coast Guard, and all equipment is maintained to the highest standards.</p>

			<p>We offer morning dives for certified divers at 8am, afternoon dives for non-certified divers at 1pm, and occasional night dives. Our dive site includes two shipwrecks, the Sea Tiger and Y0257, for an unforgettable diving experience. We welcome divers of all ages (minimum age of 10 years old), and our priority is always safety first.</p>

			<p>With 15 years of experience, Seabubbles Hawaii is dedicated to making your diving experience memorable and enjoyable. We provide a free shuttle to and from your hotel, making it easy for you to join us for a dive. Our slogan, "No Ka Oi," means "the best" in Hawaiian, and we strive to live up to that standard every day.</p>
