        DIVES AND TRAINING
    </h1>
    <P>
        Here at SeaBubbles Diving we offer four different dives depending on time of day and experience. <br>
        We also offer a diver certification course if that is something that interests you . <br>
        All of our instructors are Dive Master Certified through internationally accredited PADI. This is the highest certification available. <br>
        The ratio of guests to instructor is always low at a max of 4:1. This means our service is the best! NO KA OI! <br>
        Dive tours are roughly 2 hours long total, including training and diving. We offer local transportation to and from our operation for a small fee. <br>
        Below is a brief description of our different dives and certification course. <br>
        I hope you like fresh pineapples because they're always on deck!
        Book now so we can gurantee you a spot on our boat.

    <h2>
        SHALLOW DIVE (morning or afternoon)
    </h2>
    <p>
        Our shallow dive is for all divers. We dive in the morning around 10a.m. and in the afternoon around 2p.m. <br>
        Children 12 and over are allowed to dive on the shallow tours, as long as a guardian comes on the boat. <br>
        We can gurantee that you will get to see and interact with the animals. Sea Turtles are all over the place. <br>
        Dive tours are roughly 2 hours long total, including training and diving. <br>

    <h2>
        DEEP DIVE (morning onor afternoon)
    </h2>
    <p>
        Our deep dive is for certified divers. There are two shipwrecks that we can explore: The ______ and The _________. <br>
        Pictures are included with every dive for free. Ratios of instructor to guests are always kept low. <br>
        You are guranteed to see fish and other wildlife. Humpback whales can be seen in later months of September to November when they come closer to the shore. <br>
        We offer morning and afternoon dives 7 days a week. These dives usually take about 2 hours to complete. <br>
